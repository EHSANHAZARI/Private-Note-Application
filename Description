Project Background 

The use of mainstream note-taking apps has been on the rise since a large part of our daily lives have been transitioning into the online world. This brings up the question on how private, and secure are these note-taking apps where we put our personal information. Unfortunately, we - the customers - are not actually in control of the data we put up online which are currently being exploited by many companies or malicious individuals for their own benefits. According to our research, we found many surveys and studies about how companies collect user’s data and how company’s data which includes what they have collected from users, have frequently been breached in the last few years. In addition, further research on mainstream products in the note-taking app market such as Notion or Evernote, revealed that they are not secure or private at all as the product’s company or someone that compromises the company’s security, are able to read user’s data.
